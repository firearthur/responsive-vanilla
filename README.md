# What is this?
Simple responsive app I wrote with `HTML`, `CSS`, and vanilla `JavaScript`.
No front-end helper libraries were used.

## Note:
I went for very minimal styles to put emphasis on the code and functionality.

# Usage:
1. Unzip or clone the app.
2. Run `yarn`.
3. Run `yarn build`.
4. Drag or open `dist/index.html` in the desired browser.
5. Enjoy!

# Tech used:
1. `Webpack` for bundling and development server.
2. `css-loader` for global and local styles with `css modules`. 
3. `Babel` for transpiling `ES6+` to `ES5`.
4. `ESLint` for keeping a consistent coding style.
5. `Prettier` for things `ESLint` didn't fix.
6. `Express` server to serve static files in case we want to deploy it later.
